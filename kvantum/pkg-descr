Kvantum (by Pedram Pourang, aka. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is an
SVG-based theme engine for Qt4/Qt5 and KDE. It has a default dark theme but
goes far beyond it: you could make themes with very different looks and feels
for it and Kvantum will let you control almost every aspect of Qt widgets.
